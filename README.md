JavaStructures provides some basic (and probably naive) implementations of simple
or useful data structures in Java. Notably, the structures here are not commonly
available elsewhere, even in Apache Commons - otherwise, we would just use Apache
Commons.

## Structures

* Trie (`com.lithium3141.javastructures.trie`): a basic prefix trie, generic in both key and value.

## Tests

Unit tests, such as they are, are kept in the package `com.lithium3141.javastructures.test`.
